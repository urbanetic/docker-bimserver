## Installation

To run BIMserver in a container on your server, Docker needs to be [installed][docker-install]. On
Debian/Ubuntu Linux, this is as simple as `sudo apt-get install docker.io`.

docker build --rm -t urbanetic/bimserver:latest .

With Docker installed, running BIMserver is as simple as

You can easily forward this to port 80 using [iptables][iptables] with the command
